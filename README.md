### Government

### Capitalists
- **Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba**: `'996' is a huge blessing`.
- **Richard Liu, founder of JD.com**: `We will never force our employee to work as '996'`.
However, as a result many anonymous employees says that there is a **list** of departments which **ranked** them by overtime hours. The shortest will take punishments. And the leaders never leave evidences when ask employees to work as '996'.
- **Bai Ya, founder of Youzan**: `This will definitely be a right decision when we look back in a few years`




Principles and purposes
---

* WUHAN 996 is an initiative initiated by numerous IT practitioners in WUHAN, China, and we welcome people from other fields and countries to join the discussion.
* This is not a political movement. We firmly uphold the labor law and request employers to respect the legitimate rights and interests of their employees.

* It is great progress from closed source to open source, and it will also be great progress from open source to emphasizing labor rights at the same time. What we want is to create an open source software license that advocates workers' rights.

* We are willing to hear all positive and constructive proposals and advocate mature and responsible speech.
